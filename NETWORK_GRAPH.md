# Network Graph Visualization for Milestones

## Overview

Added a **Network Graph View** that displays milestones as circles (nodes) connected by arrows showing dependencies, similar to a PERT chart or dependency diagram.

## Features

### 1. **Network Graph Visualization**
- **Circular Nodes**: Each milestone is represented as a colored circle
- **Dependency Arrows**: Arrows point from dependency to dependent milestone
- **Color Coding**:
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** - Critical path milestones (thick red border)
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue** - In progress
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** - Completed
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange** - Blocked
  - âš« **Gray** - Not started

### 2. **Automatic Layout**
- **Layered Layout**: Uses topological sorting to arrange nodes in layers
- **Left-to-Right Flow**: Dependencies on the left, dependents on the right
- **Smart Positioning**: Nodes are spaced evenly and centered within their layer
- **No Overlaps**: Automatic spacing prevents node collisions

### 3. **Visual Elements**

#### Node Features:
- **50px radius circles** with milestone name inside
- **Critical path indicator**: Red "!" badge on critical milestones
- **Duration/slack info**: Displayed below each node
- **Hover effects**: Opacity changes on hover
- **Click to edit**: Click any node to open the edit form

#### Arrow Features:
- **Directional arrows**: Point from dependency to dependent
- **Critical path arrows**: Thick red arrows for critical dependencies
- **Regular arrows**: Thinner gray arrows for non-critical dependencies
- **Arrow heads**: Triangular arrow heads for clear direction

### 4. **View Toggle**
- **Network View** (default): Shows the graph with circles and arrows
- **Timeline View**: Shows the week-based Gantt-style timeline
- Toggle button in the toolbar to switch between views

## Component Details

### MilestoneNetworkGraph Component

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/milestones/MilestoneNetworkGraph.jsx`

**Props**:
- `milestones` (array): Array of milestone objects
- `onMilestoneClick` (function): Callback when a node is clicked

**Features**:
- SVG-based rendering for crisp graphics
- Automatic layout calculation using topological sort
- Responsive container with scroll
- Interactive nodes (clickable, hoverable)
- Animated node appearance using Framer Motion

**Layout Algorithm**:
1. **Topological Sort**: Orders milestones by dependencies
2. **Layer Assignment**: Assigns each node to a layer (depth in dependency tree)
3. **Position Calculation**: Places nodes evenly within their layer
4. **Arrow Drawing**: Calculates arrow paths between nodes

## Usage

### Viewing the Network Graph

1. Navigate to any project
2. Expand the **Deliverables** section
3. The network graph is shown by default
4. Click the **Timeline** button to switch to timeline view

### Interacting with Nodes

- **Click a node**: Opens the milestone edit form
- **Hover over a node**: Shows hover effect
- **View connections**: Follow arrows to see dependencies

### Creating Dependencies

1. Click **Add Milestone**
2. Choose **Duration-based** type
3. Select dependencies from the checklist
4. The new milestone will appear to the right of its dependencies in the graph

## Example Layout

```
[Node A] â”€â”€â†’ [Node B] â”€â”€â†’ [Node D]
    â”‚            â”‚
    â†“            â†“
[Node C] â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’ [Node E] â”€â”€â†’ [Node F]
```

- Node A: Root node (no dependencies)
- Node B: Depends on A
- Node C: Depends on A
- Node D: Depends on B
- Node E: Depends on B and C
- Node F: Depends on E

## Visual Indicators

### Critical Path
- **Red circles** with thick dark red border
- **Red arrows** between critical nodes
- **Red "!" badge** in top-left corner of node

### Status Colors
- Completed: Green circle
- In Progress: Blue circle
- Blocked: Orange circle
- Not Started: Gray circle

### Text Information
- **On node**: Milestone name (truncated if long)
- **Below node**: Duration (e.g., "5d") or "Fixed" + slack time if any

## Technical Implementation

### SVG Elements Used
- `<circle>` - Milestone nodes
- `<line>` + `<polygon>` - Dependency arrows with arrow heads
- `<foreignObject>` - Text labels on nodes
- `<text>` - Duration/slack text below nodes

### Positioning
- **X-axis**: Layer determines horizontal position
- **Y-axis**: Index within layer determines vertical position
- **Spacing**: 200px horizontal, 150px vertical between nodes
- **Padding**: 100px around edges

### Animation
- Nodes fade in with scale animation
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth transitions

## Advantages Over Timeline View

1. **Clearer Dependencies**: Visual arrows make relationships obvious
2. **Compact for Many Dependencies**: Better for complex dependency networks
3. **Focus on Relationships**: Emphasizes how milestones relate, not just when
4. **Critical Path Visible**: Easy to trace the critical path through the graph
5. **No Time Constraints**: Works even without dates (duration-based milestones)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Drag-and-drop** nodes to rearrange manually
- **Zoom and pan** for large graphs
- **Collapse/expand** sub-graphs
- **Highlight path** from selected node
- **Export** as image (PNG/SVG)
- **Different layouts**: Circular, hierarchical, force-directed
- **Minimap** for navigation in large graphs
- **Node filtering** by status or criticality
- **Curved arrows** for better aesthetics
- **Milestone grouping** by phase or category

## Troubleshooting

### Nodes Overlap
- Increase `horizontalSpacing` or `verticalSpacing` in the layout calculation
- Currently set to 200px horizontal, 150px vertical

### Arrows Don't Connect Properly
- Check that dependency IDs match milestone IDs exactly
- Verify `positions` state is being calculated correctly

### Graph Too Large
- Increase SVG `dimensions` (currently 1000x600)
- Add pan/zoom functionality
- Consider a different layout algorithm

## Files Modified

- âœ… `frontend/src/components/milestones/MilestoneNetworkGraph.jsx` - New component
- âœ… `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetails/ProjectDetails.jsx` - Added view toggle and integration
- âœ… Build successful (475.50 KB)

## Testing

1. Create multiple milestones with dependencies
2. Verify nodes appear in correct layers
3. Check arrows point in correct direction
4. Verify critical path is highlighted in red
5. Test click to edit functionality
6. Toggle between network and timeline views

The network graph provides a clear, intuitive way to visualize project milestone dependencies! ðŸŽ‰
